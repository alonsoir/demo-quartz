A demo with spring quartz to consume data from a rest api every seconds, saving data to h2, elastic,kafka, showing data using a websocket channel throug a rest controller. 

TODO

Actually you need to run locally Zookeeper and kafka in your local machine, i have to add a prebuilt container as a dependency.
